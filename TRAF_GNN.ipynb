        "*   The `metr-la.h5` dataset was successfully re-downloaded, and its integrity was verified by matching the file size of 57,038,056 bytes against the expected size.\n",
        "*   Initially, the `src/preprocessing.py` script failed with a `TypeError` due to an incorrect method of accessing data within the `metr-la.h5` HDF5 file. The error specifically occurred because the script attempted to access a group with a slice instead of a string key (`df/block0_values`).\n",
        "*   The `src/preprocessing.py` script was modified to correctly parse the HDF5 file structure by targeting `df/block0_values`, resolving the `TypeError`.\n",
        "*   After the fix, the preprocessing script successfully loaded 34,272 timesteps and 207 sensors of data, handled missing values via linear interpolation, normalized the data using Z-score, and generated sequences with a length of 12 and a prediction horizon of 3.\n",
        "*   The processed data was split into training (70% or 23,991 samples), validation (10% or 3,427 samples), and testing (20% or 6,854 samples) sets, and saved as separate NumPy arrays along with the adjacency matrix and normalization statistics.\n",
        "*   Following the successful preprocessing, the `src/demo_graphs.py` script also ran without issues, indicating that all necessary data for generating demo graphs was correctly prepared.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful completion of data preprocessing and graph generation confirms the environment is now correctly configured for further model development.\n",
        "*   The next logical steps involve building multi-view graphs using `src/build_graphs.py` and then proceeding to train the model using `src/train.py` as indicated by the preprocessing script's output.\n"
