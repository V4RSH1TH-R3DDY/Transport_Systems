# Graph Storage Directory

This directory stores the multi-view graph adjacency matrices for TRAF-GNN.

## Files Generated by build_graphs.py

After running the graph construction script, you'll find:

### Graph Adjacency Matrices
- `metr-la_A_physical.npy` - Physical road network topology
- `metr-la_A_proximity.npy` - k-NN graph based on geographic distance
- `metr-la_A_correlation.npy` - Graph based on traffic correlation patterns

### Visualizations
- `graph_comparison.png` - Side-by-side visualization of all three graphs

## Graph Format

All `.npy` files are NumPy arrays with shape `(num_nodes, num_nodes)`.

- **Value 1.0**: Edge exists between nodes
- **Value 0.0**: No edge
- **Diagonal**: Always 1.0 (self-loops)

## Loading Graphs

```python
import numpy as np

# Load all three graph views
A_physical = np.load('graphs/metr-la_A_physical.npy')
A_proximity = np.load('graphs/metr-la_A_proximity.npy')
A_correlation = np.load('graphs/metr-la_A_correlation.npy')

print(f"Physical graph shape: {A_physical.shape}")
print(f"Physical graph edges: {np.sum(A_physical > 0)}")
```

## Graph Properties

### Physical Topology Graph
- Represents actual road connections
- Sparse (low density)
- Captures network structure

### Spatial Proximity Graph
- k-nearest neighbors by distance
- Denser than physical
- Captures geographic relationships

### Traffic Correlation Graph  
- k-most correlated sensors
- Based on historical patterns
- Captures functional dependencies

## Parameters

Default k values (can be changed in build_graphs.py):
- `k_proximity = 10` - Each node connects to 10 nearest neighbors
- `k_correlation = 10` - Each node connects to 10 most correlated sensors
